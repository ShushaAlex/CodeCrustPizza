This is the server side of a pizza ordering application. Final project after studying for the backend developer. 
The following technologies were used:
- Spring Boot,
- PostgreSQL,
- Liquibase,
- Spring Security,
- Swagger,
- H2 Database,
- Docker

The project is still in development. The next steps will be to create a microservice to collect and process order statistics and ingredient accounting. There are also plans to create a UI.
